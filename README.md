Add Watermark to PDF.workflow instructions

There are five files including this readme:
1. Add Watermark to PDF.workflow
2. DRAFT.png
3. Screen shot.png
4. Right Clicking on PDF to embed watermark.png
5. README.md

The "Add Watermark...workflow" is the Automator file. Double clicking it should open this file in the Automator app.

The DRAFT.png is the watermark that will be added to each PDF page. 

The "Screen shot.png" files show the two places where you'll need to make updates to the Automator file so it can find where the DRAFT.png watermark is on your filesystem and where you want the new, watermarked files to be saved.

The "Right Clicking...png" file shows how to invoke the Quick Action. The PDF you right-click on will be watermarked and saved in location you specify in #2 of the "Screen shot.png" file.
